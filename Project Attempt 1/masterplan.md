## **1. App Overview & Objectives**

### **Objective**

Build a lightweight, AI-powered lead qualification platform that helps a data solutions provider quickly understand whether a new opportunity is worth pursuing, using actionable recommendations generated by an LLM.

### **Core Concept**

Users submit new lead opportunities.
The system stores them, processes them in the background via an LLM, and provides structured, actionable insights to Sales and Program Management teams.

### **Primary Outcomes**

* Faster lead review
* Better-informed decision-making
* Clear next steps for Sales & PMs
* Standardized understanding of opportunity requirements
* Professional, easy-to-use dashboard experience

The MVP focuses entirely on this workflow with no external integrations, single-environment deployment, and no editing of submitted leads.

## **2. Target Audience**

### **Business Users**

* Submit new data opportunities
* View insights for their own submissions
* Use AI-driven recommendations to approach clients confidently



---

## **3. Core Features & Functionality**

### **3.1 Opportunity Submission**

Business User submits:

* Opportunity Title
* Client Organization
* Contact Name & Email
* Work Description
* Type of Data Solution
* Estimated Complexity
* Expected Duration
* Required Skill Sets
* Estimated Deal Value

Submission immediately saves to the database.

### **3.2 Background AI Processing**

* Once saved, a background process triggers an LLM call.
* Insights are generated without blocking the user.
* Dashboard shows “Processing…” status.

### **3.3 AI-Generated Insights**

LLM outputs structured, actionable insights including:

**1. Intent Analysis**
**2. Gap & Risk Detection**
**3. Structured Opportunity View (Objectives, Challenges, Skill Needs)**
**4. Recommended Next Steps for Sales/PM**
**5. Suggested Team Composition**
**6. Proposed high-level approach outline**

Insights are stored separately from the raw opportunity data.

### **3.4 Dashboard (Hybrid Intelligence + Operational View)**

The dashboard includes:

#### **Operational Panels**

* Recent opportunities
* Status indicators (New, Processing, Complete)
* Filters by type, date, value, user

#### **Analytics & Charts**

* Opportunities by category
* Complexity distribution
* Monthly trendlines
* Deal value breakdown

#### **AI-Generated Aggregate Insights**

LLM analyzes all leads and produces:

* Market/industry trends
* Common skill set demands
* Frequent gaps in submissions
* Surge patterns (e.g., more AI/ML work recently)

### **3.5 Insight Presentation**

Insights displayed as:

* **Cards** (Opportunity Intent, Gaps, Recommendations, Skills, etc.)
* **Collapsible sections** inside each card for long text
* Clear, modern, uncluttered layout
* Emphasis on readability and actionability

### **3.6 Authentication & Roles**

Basic login (username/password) with:

* **Business User** (default)

No MFA or email verification for MVP.

---

## **4. High-Level Technical Stack Recommendations**

### **Frontend**

* Web-based interface
* Any lightweight framework (React suggested conceptually, but optional)
* Clean dashboard layout with cards and collapsible sections

### **Backend**

* Python or Node-based REST API (conceptually)
* Handles authentication, role validation, LLM calls, dashboard data aggregation

### **Database**

* SQLite (per BRD)
* Separate tables:

  * Opportunities
  * Insights
  * Users
  * Optional: Audit logs

### **AI / LLM**

* Single LLM prompt pipeline for:

  * Deep intent analysis
  * Gap/risk detection
  * Structured summary
  * Actionable recommendations

* Another prompt pipeline for aggregate dashboard intelligence.

### **Deployment**

* **Single production environment only**
* Local testing before deployment
* No staging or multi-environment setup needed

---

## **5. Conceptual Data Model**

### **Opportunities Table**

* id
* user_id
* title
* organization
* contact_name
* contact_email
* description
* solution_type
* complexity
* duration
* skill_sets
* deal_value
* status (new/processing/complete)
* created_at

### **Insights Table**

* id
* opportunity_id
* intent_summary
* gap_analysis
* risk_list
* structured_breakdown
* recommended_next_steps
* team_structure
* skill_highlights
* created_at

### **Users Table**

* id
* username
* hashed_password
* role (business)
* active (true/false)
* created_at

---

## **6. User Interface Design Principles**

* Clean, modern dashboard layout
* Cards + collapsible sections for insights
* High contrast, readable typography
* Consistent spacing and visual hierarchy
* Clear “New Opportunity” call-to-action
* Status tags for each opportunity (Processing, Completed)
* Mobile-friendly (optional for MVP)

Key UX goal:
**No user should struggle to find, read, or interpret critical information.**

---

## **7. Security Considerations**

* Password hashing (conceptually)
* Role-based access control at API level
* Business Users can only see their opportunities
* SQLite file protection on server
* Rate limiting for login endpoint
* Safe prompt design (avoid leaking data)

No MFA or advanced security for MVP.

---

## **8. Development Phases / Milestones**

### **Phase 1 — MVP Core**

* Authentication + roles
* Opportunity form
* Save opportunity to SQLite
* Background AI processing
* Insight generation & storage
* Insights displayed on UI
* Basic dashboard list

### **Phase 2 — Dashboard Intelligence**

* Charts (trend, distribution, etc.)
* Basic metrics
* AI-generated aggregate insights

### **Phase 4 — UI Polish**

* Cards + collapsible sections
* UX refinements
* Loading indicators, banners, badges

---

## **9. Potential Challenges & Solutions**

### **AI Output Quality**

* Solution: iterate prompts, test with real-world samples

### **Long descriptions causing inconsistent results**

* Solution: structured, multi-step prompting

### **Background processing complexity**

* Solution: keep lightweight using asynchronous tasks or timed checks

### **Dashboard chart accuracy**

* Solution: precompute aggregates in backend for faster rendering

### **Role-based access mistakes**

* Solution: clear API guards + explicit route permissions

---

## **10. Future Expansion Possibilities**

(Not included in MVP but easy to add later)

* Lead scoring system
* External API integrations (Clearbit, LinkedIn, etc.)
* Versioned insights
* Multi-tenant SaaS
* Project estimation models
* Delivery pipeline tracking
* Proposal auto-generation
